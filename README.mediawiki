'''Description:''' Port of a simple checkbook ledger to Android that can be used to keep track of finances on your computer and on the go without Internet.

==Notes==

This application was written against Android API level 32, with a current minimum target of Android 11, as it was unable to run on Android 10 or earlier.

===Questions===

<ol>
<li>
<dl>
<dt style="font-weight:bold">The iOS and macOS apps support QIF. Will this application also support QIF?</dt>
<dd>
<p>At present, this is one of the features missing from this app.</p>
<p>Since I have been away from Android programming for many years 
and things have changed, especially if you use Jetpack Compose instead of XML, I am not certain as to how to implement that with the code 
as it is now.</p>
<p>If you would like to help implement that, you are free to help out.</p>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">I am planning to switch to Android. Can I import my data from the iOS or macOS apps?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Yes, you definitely can. This app makes use of a library I made, which I included with the project, with the full intention 
of making it so that Java and Kotlin programmers can read and write the saves from those files.</p>
<p>However, this app, in its current state, will not recognize your files 
because it is not setup to recognize the extension I used for the iOS and macOS apps.</p>
<p>To get around this, change the extension from <strong>bcheck</strong> to <strong>json</strong>. 
Unlike many other file formats, this is safe to do because bcheck files are essentially JSON files.</p>

===Usage===

This application is simple enough to figure out, 
but there is an annoyance this port has that the iOS version does not,
which is a lack of a date picker.

I intend to get it added in as soon as I can, but until then, 
the date must be specifoed in <strong>YYYY-MM-DD</strong> format 
if you decide to modify it in the editor. 
This was done because that is what 
the underlying model expects and if it does not match that format, 
the date will not be modified.

Everything else should not pose much of an issue.

====Removing Transactions====

Transactions can be removed/delete 
by swiping the item from right to left on the ledger screen.

====Searching====

Searching works much the same as the original application, 
so go check the <a href="https://github.com/bryceac/BCheckbook/blob/main/README.mediawiki#Searching_Records">details</a> found there

===Support===

As I have switched from Android to iOS and 
have no Android device capable of running this application, 
I am kind of limited in what I can do to give support, 
but I will try my best to help as much as possible.

If you are familiar with Android programming and Jetpack Compose, feel free to fork this repo and issue a pull request.

The main things I need to deal with are as follows:

<dl>
<dt style="font-weight:bold">Get the bcheck extension recognized as a JSON file</dt>
<dd>
<p>This one is kind of new to me in the Android world, but I would like it so that people can select files with the extension 
<strong>bcheck</strong>, so that Mac users do not need to worry about extensions.</p>
<p>This might be as simple as just making the input and output mime types be that of the one used for plain text, 
but I strongly doubt it.</p>
